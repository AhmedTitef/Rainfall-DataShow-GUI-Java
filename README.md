# Rainfall-DataShow-GUI-Java
The application’s menu bar has two menus whose menu items should have accelerators attached to them. The first menu, File, should have two menu items:
● New: Allows the user to enter new rainfall data.
● Exit: Quits the program.
The second, View, should have three menu items. Each is the name of a different type of XYChart. When the user selects one of these menu items, a chart of that type should display with the same data. For example, in the above image, the data is displayed in a bar chart. If the user selects Area Chart, the Scene should update to display the data in an AreaChart. You may use any three of the many subclasses of XYChart.
